## About
The objective of the Metroclima project is to examine the role of the Sao Paulo Megacity emissions as drivers for regional air quality degradation and climate change. The project integrates multi-platform measurements and modeling tools to describe the atmospheric behavior of the greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants, and the effects of climate change on the air quality in the Metropolitan Area of SÃ£o Paulo.
